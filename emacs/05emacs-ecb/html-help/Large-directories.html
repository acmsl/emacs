<h3>Working with large directories</h3>

<p>If <code>ecb-source-path</code> contains directories with many files and
subdirs, especially if these directories are mounted net-drives
("many" means here something &gt; 1000, dependent on the speed of the
net-connection and the machine), actualizing the sources- and/or
directories- buffer of ECB (if displayed in current layout!) can slow
down dramatically. If this is a problem the contents of certain
directories and also the contents of the sources-buffer can be cached
which increases the speed a lot. See
<code>ecb-cache-directory-contents</code>.

<p>IMPORTANT: The full speed-advantage of this cache-mechanism is only
available if <code>ecb-show-sources-in-directories-buffer</code> is
<code>nil</code>, i.e. sources of a directory are displayed in the
ECB-sources-window. The reason is that only with a sources window the
tree-buffer contents for the sources can be cached (i.e. the
buffer-content of the ECB-sources-window) whereas with sources
displayed in the directories buffer only the disk-contents of a
directory are cached - which increases speed too but not so much as
with sources displayed in the extra window ECB-sources.

<p>The cache of a directory can be only refreshed by a POWER-click (with
mouse or keyboard) onto the related directory-node in the
directories-buffer of ECB (see <a href="Using-the-mouse.html#Using%20the%20mouse">Using the mouse</a>).
