<h4>Explicit and automatic expanding of the ECB-methods-buffer</h4>

<h5>Explicit expanding to a certain expanding level</h5>

<p>With the command <code>ecb-expand-methods-nodes</code> (bound to <kbd>C-c . 
x</kbd>) you can get a fast overlook of the contents of the source-buffer,
because this command allows precisely expanding tokens with a certain
indentation-level. So you can either expand no tokens (or with other
words collapse all tokens) or expand all tokens so see the contents of
a buffer at one glance. Or you can expand exactly that tokens of a
certain indentation level.

<p>Which node-types are expanded (rsp. collapsed) by this command
depends for semantic-sources on the options
<code>ecb-methods-nodes-expand-spec</code> and
<code>ecb-methods-nodes-collapse-spec</code>! For non-semantic-sources always
all node-types are expanded/collapsed, i.e. the two options above
takes no effect for these files.

<h5>Automatic expanding the ECB-methods-buffer</h5>

<p>If the option <code>ecb-highlight-token-with-point</code> is switched on,
then then always that node in the method-buffer is highlighted which
belongs to the current semantic-token under point in the edit-window. 
But if this node is invisible (probably because its parent node is
collapsed) then no node is highlighted if the auto. expanding feature
is switched off.

<p>You can either switch on this feature with the option
<code>ecb-auto-expand-token-tree</code> or even easier with the command
<code>ecb-toggle-auto-expand-token-tree</code>.

<p>There is another option
<code>ecb-expand-methods-switch-off-auto-expand</code> which makes both
explicit and auto. expanding best working together. See the
documentation of this option to get the details.

<p>The autom. expanding feature is only available for semantic-sources!
