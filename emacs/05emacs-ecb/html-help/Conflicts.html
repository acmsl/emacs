<h3>Known conflicts with other packages</h3>

<p>Here is a list of known conflicts of ECB with other packages and
helpful solutions/hints/workarounds:

<h4>Package avoid.el</h4>

<p>With GNU Emacs 20.X ECB must deactivate <code>mouse-avoidance-mode</code> if the
option <code>ecb-show-node-info-in-minibuffer</code> activates for at least one
ECB tree-buffer 'if-too-long or 'always. This is done automatically
but only as long ECB is activated.

<h4>Package BBDB</h4>

<p>With ECB-version &lt; 1.96 it is not recommended to use BBDB and ECB
simultaneously in one frame because each of them has its own
window-management and probably there will be conflicts. Use different
frames for ECB and BBDB!

<p>But beginning with ECB 1.96 you can use one of the window-managers
escreen.el or winring.el (see <a href="Window-managers-and-ECB.html#Window-managers%20and%20ECB">Window-managers and ECB</a>). With such
a window-manager ECB and BBDB should work very well together - even in
the same frame!

<h4>Package calculator.el</h4>

<p>If the edit-window is already splitted then calling <code>calculator</code> uses
the whole "other" edit-window for the calculator. With an unsplitted
edit-window the calculator window has it´s normal size of about 2
lines. Therefore it´s recommended to set <code>calculator-electric-mode</code>
during ECB activation to not nil so calculator uses always the
echo-area instead of creating a new small window!

<h4>Package calendar.el</h4>

<p>With activated ECB <code>calendar</code> does not shrink it´s window to the small
size but splits the window equally. But if you add this to your
<code>.emacs</code> it works:

<br><pre>(add-hook 'initial-calendar-window-hook
          (function (lambda ()
                      (when (and ecb-minor-mode
                                 (ecb-point-in-edit-window))
                        ;; if no horizontal split then nothing
                        ;; special to do
                        (or (= (frame-width) (window-width))
                            (shrink-window (- (window-height) 9))))
                     )))
</pre>

<h4>Package cygwin-mount.el</h4>

<p>There can be a conflict between ECB and cygwin-mount.el if the
following conditions are true:

<ul>
<li>You are working with cygwin-mount.el (sounds clear :-)
<li>You have set <code>cygwin-mount-build-mount-table-asynch</code> to not
nil
<li>ECB is automatically started after starting Emacs (e.g. with
<code>ecb-auto-activate</code> or calling <code>ecb-activate</code> in
<code>window-setup-hook</code>)
<li>Your Emacs-setup contains a call of <code>cygwin-mount-activate</code>. 
</ul>

<p>Under these circumstances Emacs 21.X sometimes eats up the whole CPU (at
least with Windows XP) and the cygwin-mount-table is never build.

<p>But there is an easy work-around: Call <code>cygwin-mount-activate</code>
first *AFTER* ECB is activated. This can be done with the hook
<code>ecb-activate-hook</code>:

<br><pre>(add-hook 'ecb-activate-hook
          (function (lambda ()
                      (require 'cygwin-mount)
                      (setq cygwin-mount-build-mount-table-asynch t)
                      (cygwin-mount-activate))))
</pre>

<h4>Package escreen.el</h4>

<p>Beginning with version 1.96 ECB supports the window-manager
escreen.el. See <a href="Window-managers-and-ECB.html#Window-managers%20and%20ECB">Window-managers and ECB</a>.

<h4>Package follow-mouse.el</h4>

<p>The following is only relevant for Emacs 20.X!

<p>ECB works very well with follow-mouse if follow-mouse is turned on
<strong>BEFORE</strong> ECB is activated (e.g. within the
<code>ecb-activate-hook</code>). But if you activate follow-mouse first
after ECB is already activated, then the follow-mouse stuff prevents
the complete node-name to be displayed in the echo-area if mouse moves
over it. Because ECB has a much more intelligent mouse tracking
mechanism than follow-mouse the follow-mouse stuff profit from ECB and
works even better and saver as without activated ECB!

<h4>Package Gnus (Newsreader)</h4>

<p>With ECB-version &lt; 1.96 it is not recommended to use Gnus and ECB
simultaneously in one frame because each of them has its own
window-management and probably there will be conflicts. Use different
frames for ECB and Gnus!

<p>But beginning with ECB 1.96 you can use one of the window-managers
escreen.el or winring.el (see <a href="Window-managers-and-ECB.html#Window-managers%20and%20ECB">Window-managers and ECB</a>). With such
a window-manager ECB and Gnus should work very well together - even in
the same frame!

<h4>Package JDEE (Java Development Environment)</h4>

<p>JDEE has a lot of "dialogs" where the user can select among several
choices. An example is importing classes via the command
<code>jde-import-find-and-import</code>. These dialogs are strongly designed
to work in an environment where a new temporary window is created, the
contents of the dialog are displayed in the new window, the user
select his choice and hits [OK]. After that the new window is deleted
and the selection is performed (for example the chosen import
statement are inserted in the source-buffer.

<p>ECB can be work very well with this dialogs but only if no
<strong>durable</strong> compilation-window is used, i.e. if the option
<code>ecb-compile-window-height</code> is nil. See <a href="Temp--and-compile-buffers.html#Temp-%20and%20compile-buffers">Temp- and compile-buffers</a>.

<p>If <code>ecb-compile-window-height</code> is not <code>nil</code> then these
JDEE-dialogs will not work correct!

<h4>Package scroll-all.el (scroll-all-mode)</h4>

<p>ECB advices <code>scroll-all-mode</code> so it is working correct during
running ECB. This means if point stays in an edit-window and the
edit-window is splitted then both edit-windows are scrolled by
<code>scroll-all-mode</code> and no other window! If point stays in any
other window just this selected window is scrolled. This is the only
senseful behavior of <code>scroll-all-mode</code> with ECB.

<h4>Package tmm.el (Text mode menubar)</h4>

<p>In general this library does not work perfectly with ECB. But if the
option <code>ecb-other-window-jump-behavior</code> is not set to <code>all</code>
then it should work acceptable. Beginning with version 1.95.2 ECB
ensures autom. that <code>tmm-menubar</code> works - regardless of the value
of <code>ecb-other-window-jump-behavior</code>.

<h4>Package VC (Version Control)</h4>

<p>The variable <code>vc-delete-logbuf-window</code> must be set to nil during
active ECB. This can be done with the hooks mentioned in <a href="Elisp-programming.html#Elisp%20programming">Elisp programming</a>.

<h4>Package winner.el (winner-mode)</h4>

<p><code>winner-mode</code> is autom. disabled as long as ECB is running. ECB
has its own window-management which is completely incompatible with
<code>winner-mode</code>! But <code>winner-mode</code> makes also not really sense
with ECB.

<h4>Package winring.el</h4>

<p>Beginning with version 1.96 ECB supports the window-manager
winring.el. See <a href="Window-managers-and-ECB.html#Window-managers%20and%20ECB">Window-managers and ECB</a>.
