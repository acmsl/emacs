<h3>Working with the edit-window</h3>

<p>ECB offers you all what you need to work with the edit-window as if
the edit-window would be the only window of the ECB-frame.

<p>ECB offers you to advice the following functions so they work best with ECB:

<ul>
<li><code>other-window</code>
<li><code>delete-window</code>
<li><code>delete-other-windows</code>
<li><code>delete-windows-on</code>
<li><code>split-window-horizontally</code>
<li><code>split-window-vertically</code>
<li><code>split-window</code>
<li><code>display-buffer</code>
<li><code>switch-to-buffer</code>
<li><code>switch-to-buffer-other-window</code>
<li><code>other-window-for-scrolling</code>
</ul>

<p>The behavior of the adviced functions is (slightly simplified):

<ul>
<li>All these adviced functions behaves exactly like their corresponding
original functions but they always act as if the edit-window(s) of ECB
would be the only window(s) of the ECB-frame. So the edit-window(s) of
ECB seems to be a normal Emacs-frame to the user.

<li>If there is a durable compile-window (see <a href="Temp--and-compile-buffers.html#Temp-%20and%20compile-buffers">Temp- and compile-buffers</a>) then all compilation-buffers in the sense of
<code>ecb-compilation-buffer-p</code> will be displayed in the
compile-window.

<li>If called in another frame than the ECB-frame these functions behave
exactly like the not adviced original versions! 
</ul>

<p>ATTENTION: If you want to work within the edit-window with splitting
and unsplitting the edit-window(s) it is highly recommended to use the
adviced-functions of ECB instead of the original Emacs-functions (see
above). Per default ECB advices all of the functions mentioned
above but with the option <code>ecb-advice-window-functions</code> you can
customizes which functions should be adviced by ECB. Please read
carefully the documentation of this option!

<p>Another interesting option in the context of the edit-window and these
adviced functions is <code>ecb-layout-always-operate-in-edit-window</code>!

<h4>Documentation of the adviced window functions</h4>

<p>This section describes for every adviced window function (s.a.) how it
differs from the original version. Only the differences are mentioned,
so if you want the full documentation of such a function call
<code>describe-function</code> or <kbd>C-h f</kbd>.

Around-advice <code>ecb</code>: Makes this function compatible with ECB if
called in or for the ecb-frame. It displays all buffers which are
"compilation-buffers" in the sense of
<code>ecb-compilation-buffer-p</code> in the compile-window of ECB. If the
compile-window is temporally hidden then it will be displayed first.

<p>If there is no compile-window (<code>ecb-compile-window-height</code> is
nil) then it splits the edit-window if unsplitted and displays
<var>BUFFER</var> in the other edit-window but only if
<code>pop-up-windows</code> is not nil (otherwise the edit-window will not
splitted).

<p>If called from outside the edit-area for a non-"compilation-buffers"
(s.a.) then it behaves as if called from within an edit-window if
<code>display-buffer</code> is contained in
<code>ecb-layout-always-operate-in-edit-window</code>: It depends on
<code>pop-up-windows</code> if the edit-window is automatically splitted ot
not. If <code>ecb-layout-always-operate-in-edit-window</code> does not
contain <code>display-buffer</code> then the buffer is displayed in the
edit-window without splitting it (if unsplitted).

<p>If called for other frames it works like the original version.

<p>"compilation-buffers" in the sense of

compile-window of ECB (if <code>ecb-compile-window-height</code> is not nil)
- if the compile-window is temporally hidden then it will be displayed
first. If you do not want this you have to modify the options
<code>ecb-compilation-buffer-names</code>,

Around-advice <code>ecb</code>: The ECB-version of
<code>switch-to-buffer-other-window</code>. Works exactly like the original
but with some adaptions for ECB so this function works in a
"natural" way:

<p>If called in any special ecb-window of the current ECB-layout then it
goes always to the first edit-window and then goes on as if called
from this edit-window.

<p>If a compile-window is used (i.e. <code>ecb-compile-window-height</code> is
not nil) then "compilation-buffers" in the sense of
<code>ecb-compilation-buffer-p</code> are always displayed in the
compile-window. If the compile-window is temporally hidden then it
will be displayed first. If no compile-window is used it behaves like
the original.

<p>If called from within the compile-window then "compilation-buffers"
will be displayed still there and all other buffers are displayed in
one of the edit-windows - if the destination-buffer is already
displayed in one of the edit-windows then this one is used otherwise
it behaves like the original.

<p>If called within an edit-window it behaves like the original function
except for compilation-buffers (if a compile-window is used, see
above).
