<h4>Group ecb-directories</h4>

<p>This group contains the following options:

<p>
<table width="100%">

<td align="left"><b>add-path-for-not-matching-files</b><i>

<td align="right">User Option</td>
</tr>
</table>
<table width="95%" align="center">
<tr><td>
Add path of a file to <code>ecb-source-path</code> if not already contained. 
This is done during the auto. windows synchronization which happens if
a file is opened not via the file/directory-browser of ECB. In such a
situation ECB adds the path of the new file auto. to
<code>ecb-source-path</code> at least temporally for the current Emacs
session. This option defines two things:

<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li>Should only the root-part (which means for Unix-like systems always
'/' and for windows-like systems the drive) of the new file be added
as source-path to <code>ecb-source-path</code> or the whole directory-part? 
<li>Should this path be added for future sessions too?
</ol>

<p>The value of this option is a cons-cell where the car is a boolean for
1. and the cdr is a boolean for 2.

<p>A value of not nil for the car (1.) is reasonably if a user often
opens files not via the ECB-browser which are not located in any of
the paths of <code>ecb-source-path</code> because then only one path for
each drive (windows) or the root-path (Unix) is added to the directory
buffer of ECB.

Automatically expand the directory tree to the current source file. 
There are three options:

<ul>
<li><code>best</code>: Expand the best-matching source-path
<li><code>first</code>: Expand the first matching source-path
<li><code>nil</code>: Do not automatically expand the directory tree.

<table width="95%" align="center">
<tr><td>
Cache contents of directories.

<p>This can be useful if <code>ecb-source-path</code> contains directories with
many files and subdirs, especially if these directories are mounted
net-drives ("many" means here something &gt; 1000, dependent of the speed
of the net-connection and the machine). For these directories
actualizing the sources- and/or directories- buffer of ECB (if
displayed in current layout!) can slow down dramatically so a caching
increases speed a lot.

<p>The value of this option is a list where each element is a cons-cell
and looks like:

<br><pre>  (&lt;dir-regexp&gt; . &lt;filenumber threshold&gt;) with
</pre>

<dl>
<dt><code>&lt;dir-regexp&gt;:</code>
<dd>Regular expression a directory must match to be cached. 
<br><dt><code>&lt;filenumber threshold&gt;:</code>
<dd>Number of directory contents must exceed this number. 
</dl>

<p>A directory will we only be cached if and only if the directory-name
matches one rexexp of this option and its content-number exceeds the
related threshold.

<p>The cache entry for a certain directory will be refreshed and
actualized only by using the POWER-click (see
<code>ecb-primary-secondary-mouse-buttons</code>) in the directories-buffer
of ECB (see <a href="Using-the-mouse.html#Using%20the%20mouse">Using the mouse</a>).

<p>Examples:

<p>A value of <code>("~/bigdir*" . 1000)</code> means the contents of every
subdirectory of the home-directory will be cached if the directory
contains more than 1000 entries and its name begins with "bigdir".

<p>A value of <code>(".*" . 1000)</code> caches every directory which has more
than 1000 entries.

<p>A value of <code>(".*" . 0)</code> caches every directory regardless of the
number of entries."

example a function could be added which performs calls of
<code>local-set-key</code> to define new keybindings only for the
directories-buffer of ECB.

the ECB-directory-buffer by this name, e.g. by a call of <code>set-buffer</code>.

<table width="95%" align="center">
<tr><td>
Function which re-sorts the menu-entries of the directories buffer.

<p>If a function then this function is called to re-arrange the
menu-entries of the combined menu-entries of the user-menu-extensions
of <code>ecb-directories-menu-user-extension</code> and the built-in-menu
<code>ecb-directories-menu</code>. If nil then no special sorting will be
done and the user-extensions are placed in front of the
built-in-entries.

<p>The function get one argument, a list of menu-entries. For the format
of this argument see <code>ecb-directories-menu-user-extension</code>. The
function must return a new list in the same format. Of course this
function can not only re-arrange the entries but also delete entries
or add new entries.

</table>
<table width="95%" align="center">
<tr><td>
User extensions for the popup-menu of the directories buffer.

<p>Value is a list of elements of the following type: Each element
defines a new menu-entry and is a list containing two sub-elements,
whereas the first is the name of the menu-entry and the second the
function (a function symbol or a lambda-expression) being called if
the menu-entry is selected. If there is no second sub-element and the
first one is the string "--" then a non-selectable menu-separator
is displayed.

<p>The function must follow the following guidelines: It takes one
argument which is the tree-buffer-node of the selected node (means the
node for which the popup-menu has been opened). With the function
<code>tree-node-get-data</code> the related data of this node is accessible
and returns in case of the directories buffer the directory for which
the popup-menu has been opened. The function can do any arbitrary
things with this directory.

<p>Example for such a menu-function:

<br><pre>(defun ecb-my-special-dir-popup-function (node)
  (let ((node-data=dir (tree-node-get-data node)))
     (message "Dir under node: %s" node-data=dir)))
</pre>

<p>Per default the user-extensions are added at the beginning of the
built-in menu-entries of <code>ecb-directories-menu</code> but the whole menu
can be re-arranged with <code>ecb-directories-menu-sorter</code>.

<p>If you change this option you have to restart ECB to take effect.

<tr><td>
Automatically display current default-directory after activating ECB.

<p>If a file-buffer is displayed in the edit-window then ECB synchronizes
its tree-buffers to this file-buffer - at least if the option
<code>ecb-window-sync</code> it not nil. So for this situation
<code>ecb-display-default-dir-after-start</code> takes no effect but this
option is for the case if no file-buffer is displayed in the
edit-window after startup:

<p>If true then ECB selects autom. the current default-directory after
activation even if no file-buffer is displayed in the edit-window. 
This is useful if ECB is autom. activated after startup of Emacs and
Emacs is started without a file-argument. So the directory from which
the startup has performed is auto. selected in the ECB-directories
buffer and the ECB-sources buffer displays the contents of this
directory.

If true then uses speedbar for directories, sources or methods. This
means that speedbar is integrated in the ECB-frame and is displayed in
that window normally displaying the standard ECB-directories-buffer,
ECB-sources-buffer or ECB-methods-buffer.

<p>This option takes effect in all layouts which contain either a
directory window, a sources window or a method window.

<p>This option can have four valid values:
<ul>
<li><code>nil</code>: Do not use speedbar (default)
<li><code>dir</code>: Use speedbar instead of the standard directories-buffer
<li><code>source</code>: Use speedbar instead of the standard sources-buffer
<li><code>method</code>: Use speedbar instead of the standard methods-buffer
</ul>

<p>Note: For directories and sources a similar effect and usability is
available by setting this option to <code>nil</code> (or <code>method</code>) and
setting <code>ecb-show-sources-in-directories-buffer</code> to not
<code>nil</code>, because this combination displays also directories and
sources in one window.

<p><code>ecb-use-speedbar-instead-native-tree-buffer</code> is for people who
like the speedbar way handling directories and source-files or methods
and want it in conjunction with ECB.
