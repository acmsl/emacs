<h3>Optimize scrolling in the edit-window</h3>

<p>Emacs 20.X seems to slow down scrolling if there is a horizontal split
in the frame and/or a lot of overlays in the buffer which is scrolled. 
This is independent of ECB! But because almost all layouts of ECB uses
horizontal splits of the frame and because ECB is based on semantic
which uses overlays intensively there can be poor scrolling
performance in large buffers, especially with java-buffers in
<code>jde-mode</code>.

<p>This scrolling performance can be increased a lot if the options
<code>scroll-conservatively</code> and <code>scroll-step</code> are set
appropriately: The former one should have a value of 0 during ECB is
active and the latter one a value of either 0 or &gt; 1 (the exact value
depends on the power of your machine).

<p>As far as we know this is not a problem of Emacs 21.X or XEmacs. With
these versions of Emacs there should be no scrolling problem even with
<code>scroll-step</code> has value 1.
