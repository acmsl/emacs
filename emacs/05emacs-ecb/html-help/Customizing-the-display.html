<h4>Customizing the display of the Methods-buffer</h4>

<p>The ECB-Methods buffer is probably the most important browsing window
offered by ECB. It displays all parsing informations of the current
source-buffer (the buffer displayed in the edit-window).

<p>Normally ECB gets all informations displayed in this Methods-buffer
from the semantic-library - at least for semantic-sources. This
library parses auto. the current source-buffer in the edit-window of
ECB and returns all information in form of <dfn>tokens</dfn> to ECB which
displays them in a browse-able form in its Method-buffer. See <a href="ECB-Methods-buffer.html#ECB%20Methods-buffer">ECB Methods-buffer</a> for information how to use the Methods-buffer.

<p>There are several options to customize which tokens ECB should display
in general, if the tokens should be collapsed or expanded, how to
fontify them (i.e. syntax-highlighting) and something more.

<dl>
<dt><code>ecb-show-tokens</code>
<dd>Which semantic-tokens (e.g. types, methods, variables etc.) should be
displayed and should they be collapsed, flattened or expanded. Sorting
is also possible.

<br><dt><code>ecb-font-lock-tokens</code>
<dt><code>ecb-type-token-display</code>
<dd>How to fontify the tokens in the Method-buffer

<br><dt><code>ecb-token-display-function</code>
<dd>ECB and semantic offer several predefined functions for displaying the
tokens. Here you can customize, what informations tokens should
contain (only the method-name or the whole signature or something
else) and what notation should be used, e.g. UML or not.

</dl>

<p>These are the most important options for this topic but it is
recommended to have a look into the customize-group <code>ecb-methods</code>
(see <a href="ecb-methods.html#ecb-methods">ecb-methods</a>) and check all the options offered there!

<p>All these options are only relevant for semantic-sources and take no
effect for non-semantic-sources!
