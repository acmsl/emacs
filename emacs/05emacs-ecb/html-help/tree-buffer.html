<h3>The library tree-buffer.el</h3>

<p>The library tree-buffer.el is ECB independent and can be used for
other applications too. But such an application is not allowed to use
any of the variables of tree-buffer.el especially not the variable
<strong>tree-buffers</strong>!

<p><code>tree-buffers</code>: Only for internal use. It contains all
tree-buffers of current Emacs-instance, means <strong>all</strong>
tree-buffers of <strong>all</strong> applications which uses currently
tree-buffers. Every application must store its own collection of
tree-buffers in an own variable! For example: ECB stores its
tree-buffer set in <code>ecb-tree-buffers</code>!

<p>An application may only use the methods tree-buffer.el provides but no
internal variables!
