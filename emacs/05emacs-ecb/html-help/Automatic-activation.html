<h3>Automatic activation and deactivation</h3>

<p>There are three options for auto. (de)activation ECB after Emacs-start
and also major-mode based.

<dl>
<dt><code>ecb-auto-activate</code>
<dd>This option is for auto. activating ECB after Emacs-startup. Set this
to not nil and ECB will automatically be started after Emacs comes up.

<br><dt><code>ecb-major-modes-activate</code>
<dt><code>ecb-major-modes-deactivate</code>
<dd>These option give you the possibility to activate (rsp. deactivate)
ECB on a major-mode basis, means you can define for which major-modes
ECB should be activated and for which modes it should deactivated (See
<a href="Activation-hook-sequence.html#Activation%20hook-sequence">Activation hook-sequence</a> and <a href="Deactivation-hook-sequence.html#Deactivation%20hook-sequence">Deactivation hook-sequence</a>).

<p>If activating or deactivating is too strong you can also customize ECB
with these two option only hiding/showing it's ECB-windows
(tree-buffers) on a major-mode basis. At last this is nothing more
than auto. calling <code>ecb-toggle-ecb-windows</code> (see <a href="Interactive-ECB-commands.html#Interactive%20ECB%20commands">Interactive ECB commands</a>) depending which major-mode is active. 
</dl>

<p>If you activate ECB on a major-mode basis you probably want switch off
displaying the tip of the day. You can do this with the option
<code>ecb-tip-of-the-day</code>.
