<h3>ECB Methods-buffer</h3>

<p>The <dfn>ECB-Methods</dfn> buffer contains all parsed and recognized tokens
of the current source-buffer. It is called "Method-buffer" because
ECB is mostly designed for browsing sourcecode files and for
programming-languages these tokens are often methods (and variables
etc.) To simplify explanations we talk in the following only about
methods and variables - but in general the method-buffer can contain
any kind of tokens (e.g. sections and subsections for texinfo
buffers).

<ul>
<li>When a method/variable is selected with the primary mouse button
(see <a href="Using-the-mouse.html#Using%20the%20mouse">Using the mouse</a>) or RETURN (see <a href="Using-the-keyboard.html#Using%20the%20keyboard">Using the keyboard</a>) the
edit buffer will jump to the method/variable.

<p>IMPORTANT: If you use the POWER-click (i.e. hold down the SHIFT-key
while clicking with the primary mouse button (see <a href="Using-the-mouse.html#Using%20the%20mouse">Using the mouse</a>)
or RETURN (see <a href="Using-the-keyboard.html#Using%20the%20keyboard">Using the keyboard</a>)) on a node in this buffer then
the edit-buffer will be narrowed to the selected token (see also
option <code>ecb-token-visit-post-actions</code>). But this works only for
sources parsed by semantic, not by imenu or etags!

</p><li>Clicking on a method/variable with the secondary mouse button or C-RETURN
(see <a href="Usage-of-ECB.html#Usage%20of%20ECB">Usage of ECB</a>) will jump to the method in the other edit window.

<li>Right clicking on a method/variable will open a popup menu where
different operation on the item under the mouse cursor can be
performed. 
</ul>
