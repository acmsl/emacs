<tr><td>
Advice functions to be more intelligent if used with ECB. You can
choose the following functions to be adviced by ECB so they behave as
if the edit-window(s) of ECB would be the only windows(s) of the
ECB-frame:

<ul>
<li><code>other-window</code>
For this one see also the option <code>ecb-other-window-jump-behavior</code>! 
<li><code>delete-window</code>
<li><code>delete-other-windows</code>
<li><code>delete-windows-on</code>
<li><code>split-window-horizontally</code>
<li><code>split-window-vertically</code>
<li><code>split-window</code>
If this advice is enabled then <code>split-window-vertically</code> and
<code>split-window-horizontally</code> are autom. enabled too! 
<li><code>switch-to-buffer</code>
<li><code>switch-to-buffer-other-window</code>
<li><code>display-buffer</code>
Especially if <code>ecb-compile-window-height</code> is not nil it is
strongly recommended not to disable this advice! 
<li><code>other-window-for-scrolling</code>
If this advice is enabled then the following functions scroll always
the first edit-window if the edit-window is splitted, point stays in
the "other" edit-window and there is no durable compilation-window
(see <code>ecb-compile-window-height</code>):

<ul>
<li><code>scroll-other-window</code>
<li><code>scroll-other-window-down</code>
<li><code>beginning-of-buffer-other-window</code>
<li><code>end-of-buffer-other-window</code>
</ul>

<p>This advice is per default not enabled. 
</ul>

<p>For working most conveniently with ECB it is the best to advice all
these functions, because then all the standard shortcuts of these
functions are also usable with ECB without doing anything else. Also
other packages can interact best with ECB if these functions are all
adviced. If these adviced functions are called in another frame than
the ECB-frame they behave all exactly like the not adviced versions!

<p>But please read also the following:

<p>Normally all packages should work correct with ECB and it´s adviced
functions but if there occur problems with a package cause of some of
these adviced functions ECB offers the following fall-back solution:

<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li>Deactivate in <code>ecb-advice-window-functions</code> all the
adviced-functions which make problems with other packages. 
<li>For every of the advice-able functions &lt;adv-func&gt; ECB offers a
interactively function named "ecb-&lt;adv-func&gt;" which does exactly the
same as the adviced version of &lt;adv-func&gt;. Use "ecb-&lt;adv-func&gt;"
instead the original one to get the proper ECB behavior even if the
function is not adviced anymore. 
<li>You can bind in <code>ecb-activate-hook</code> the standard-shortcut of
&lt;adv-func&gt; to "ecb-&lt;adv-func&gt;" and rebind it in
<code>ecb-deactivate-hook</code> to &lt;adv-func&gt;. 
<li>Now you have the best of both worlds: The problematic package works
and you have the ECB-behavior of &lt;adv-func&gt; as if it would be adviced.
</ol>

<p>Here is an example: Suppose you must deactivating the advice for
<code>switch-to-buffer-other-window</code>. Then you deactivate this
function with this option and you can use
<code>ecb-switch-to-buffer-other-window</code> instead. Bind the shortcut
you normally use for <code>switch-to-buffer-other-window</code> to
<code>ecb-switch-to-buffer-other-window</code> (use <code>ecb-activate-hook</code>
for this) and rebind it to the original function in the
<code>ecb-deactivate-hook</code>.

Fix size of the ECB-windows/buffers even after frame-resizing. The fix
type (valid values are nil, t, width and height) can either be set on
a layout-basis (means a different value for each layout) or one value
can be set for all layouts.

<p>For a detailed description of the valid values see description of
<code>window-size-fixed</code> which is newly introduced in GNU Emacs 21 and
is only available there. Therefore this option takes only effect with
GNU Emacs 21.

<p>Note1: Manually resizing the ECB-windows via <code>enlarge-window</code>,
<code>shrink-window</code>, <code>mouse-drag-vertical-line</code> and
<code>mouse-drag-mode-line</code> is still possible even if the window-sizes
are fixed for frame-resizing!

<p>Note2: The description of <code>window-size-fixed</code> in the
Elisp-info-manual is more detailed than the description offered by
<kbd>C-h v</kbd>!

<p>Note3: With current Emacs 21.2.X there seems to be no distinction
between <code>width</code>, <code>height</code> and <code>t</code>. Therefore this
option takes no effect (means all ecb-windows have always unfixed
sizes) if <code>ecb-compile-window-height</code> is not <code>nil</code>.

<p>Per default no window-size fixing has been done.

Adviced window functions work always in the edit-window. If we are in
an ECB special buffer (methods, directories, etc), and any of the
adviced windowing functions is called (see
<code>ecb-advice-window-functions</code>), we will select the
<code>ecb-edit-window</code> first. This is useful if you have any functions
that use such functions and you don't want them to just error with a
method complaining that the current buffer can not be split, or
something similar.

<p>Because this may not be desirable in all situations and all adviced
functions this can be enabled separately for every advisable function
(see also <code>ecb-advice-window-functions</code>). If the symbol of an
adviced function is contained in the value of this option, then the
edit-window is first selected otherwise either an error is reported or
some other special reaction; see the documentation of the adviced
functions for this.

<p>For <code>other-window</code>, <code>other-window-for-scrolling</code> and
<code>switch-to-buffer-other-window</code> this makes no sense, therefore
you can not enable this for them.

<p>Per default this is enabled for <code>delete-window</code>,
<code>delete-other-windows</code>, <code>switch-to-buffer</code>.

Select a window layout of ECB. Value is any arbitrary string. There are
four different types of layouts: left, right, top and left-right,
which means the location of the ECB-tree-windows in the ECB-frame. 
Currently there are 20 predefined layouts; names see below. You can
savely try out any of them by changing this value and saving it only
for the current session. If you are sure which layout you want you can
save it for future sessions. To get a picture of the layout for name
&lt;name&gt; call `ecb-show-layout-help'. <code>ecb-layout-function-9</code>.

Specifies the sizes of the ECB windows for each layout. The easiest
way (and also the strongly recommended way) to change this variable is
to change the window sizes by dragging the window borders using the
mouse and then store the window sizes by calling the command
<code>ecb-store-window-sizes</code>. Next time the layout is redrawn the
values stored in this option will be used.

<p>If <code>ecb-store-window-sizes</code> is used then the windows sizes are
stored per default as fractions of current frame-width and -height of
the ecb-frame, so the stored values will "work" for other frame
sizes too. But if you call <code>ecb-store-window-sizes</code> with a
prefix-argument then the fixed values of current width and height are
stored!

<p>If this option is set "by hand" (i.e. not by
<code>ecb-store-window-sizes</code>) then the following is important:
<ul>
<li>It is recommended to use fractions of frame-width and -height!. 
<li>The order of the sequence of the inserted window sizes must be the same as
<code>other-window</code> (the not-adviced version!) would walk!
